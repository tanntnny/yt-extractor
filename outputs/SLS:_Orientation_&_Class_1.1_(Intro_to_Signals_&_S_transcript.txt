[Part 1] Okay. All right. Here I am. Okay. Chan-chai, bring me the real wage. Okay. You can contact me via email. If you have any questions, you can direct my search to me via MST. Okay. We're going to be here for about 17 weeks. Okay. Here are some of the topics. Okay. We're going to be learning. Okay. I'll just sum up them later on. Okay. As I see fit. Okay. Because it turns out last year something is so tight in here at the end. Okay. Maybe if I have time, I'll adjust that a little bit. Okay. Let's take a look at this. So this course schedule may change a little. Okay. I'll see. Okay. Here for the course evaluations. Oh, this one looks similar. How come there's no notes? Okay. Homeworks, 4%. Okay. I'll try to assign you some homeworks every week. Okay. And it's be counted as 4%. Okay. That means you, if you submit the homeworks, you'll get, you'll get two points. If you submit it late, you've got one point and you got, you didn't submit at all. You got the zero point for that. Okay. Class participation. Oh, I haven't give you any quiz at the end of this class participation yet today for today's class participation yet. Okay. I'll think about it later. Okay. Maybe we'll try to do usually just like in pop up reading statistics. Okay. Give you at the end of the class quiz. Okay. But I'm not sure about today. Okay. Maybe I'll do something else. Okay. In my cost view, if you answer the question correctly, we can, we have a record of how you answer that. Okay. I'll load that. Keep it as class participation. Okay. If we counted as, you know, class participation for 4%. Okay. If I give you questions and all of you can answer that. Okay. You got points. Okay. You cannot answer that. You lose points for that. Okay. There'll be two quizzes. Okay. For 8% each. Okay. Here, according to this. Okay. Quiz number one and quiz number two. Okay. I'm not sure about that one yet. Okay. It will change a little. Okay. I'll see. Okay. Meet term exam 30 38%. Okay. And final exam 30% the sum of 100%. Okay. You allow one non-tocammable calculator in the exams in the quiz. I'm not sure about the notes and the books. Usually in the class, you are not allowed any, if we are taking the exam on site. Okay. You're not allowed any books or notes in the exams. Okay. But if there is any change, but if it's online. Okay. Usually I can't. I can't regulate that. So I will let you open the notes. Okay. Because I'll see. I'll see later. Okay. I'll see it later. Okay. For this rule. Okay. And here are some of the reference. Okay. We're going to learn signal and systems. Okay. The way we grade. Okay. Yeah. The way the way we give you the grades. Okay. It's based on the curve. Okay. I'll show you how I assign the letter grades at the end for you. Okay. Just like in advanced mathematics last semester. Hold on a second. Let me show you. Yeah. There was a person asking about it. In the previous class or even this is I see. So everybody's pretty much know. Let's see. Score grades. 2021. Scores. Okay. Let me. Okay. Okay. OK. OK, here are some. OK, let me share the screen. OK, here here's what I give you grades. OK, uh, first of all, I collect all the numbers like this. OK, all the scores and scale it according to the the percentage. OK, this is uh, and so on and at the end. OK. Uh, here. You suppose you get you get this this last columns here? OK, suppose you got the last columns, which is 100% OK. This is how I assign the grades. OK, uh, hold on. Sword. I will sort it from the largest to smallest like this. OK, and. I have one columns and high OK. One columns here will see the difference. OK, these columns here will be the difference between the first the what the your score and the previous score. OK, your score and the previous score. So the one with before you OK with higher score than you OK. So I arrange it according to this OK and the little grades when there is a gap OK when there is a big gap. OK, for example here OK, little grade a you see this one. There's not much gap OK, 0.190.020.0 0 and so on and I found a big gap at 1.41 OK, 1.41 would be a big gap between 91.61 and 90.19 OK, so this is a big gap here. So you got a different grade. OK, from the previous person. You see on me OK and like this one there's a big gap of 2.66 OK, so the person before you OK, we got B plus and you're going to get B. OK, and that's how we get the gaps OK, 1.83 and so on. OK, that's how you get the grades OK, so. Basically in Thai we call it in kum OK, so it depends on how your performance really relative to your friends OK, your grades relative to your friends. If your performance in the other scores OK, your grade collected is similar to your friends, you and your friend should get the same grade OK, if your performance is different from your friends OK, you and your friend can get. If. If you will, you will your performance different from your friend, you're going to get you and your friends can get this different grade. For example here CC and C plus the big gap is OK, this person got 767 and this person got 71.05 and you can see these two person may not deserve the same grade OK, so they're going to get different grade for that. OK. And that's how we assign the grade at the end OK. Any questions on assigning the grades? Any questions? OK, hope not. Alright, homework count for 4% OK, class persuasion 4% quizzes to times 8% midterm exam 38% and final exam 88% OK. Homework of course, classification will be collected during in online OK, quiz will be online. However, midterm exam and final exam might be on site if the university is open. OK, if it's not open, of course, it must be online OK, if it's open, we're going to take it on site OK, so if you are not in Bangkok OK, and if you the university is open plan to come to Bangkok OK, during the midterm exam week, which is the what? First or maybe the second week of March, I'm not sure. OK, during that week OK, week nine and come to Bangkok. Second week of May OK, to take the exams. Alright. Any other questions? Most likely this this whole class going to be online OK, however, if you have any questions at all OK, please feel free to ask OK. If you have any questions please feel free to drop me an email OK, you got my email here OK, but I don't often check my email the problem or sometimes the email might might be dropped you know so I'll see about that. But if you can send me messages through MS team, I would be able to see it every time I come into the lecture OK, so it's probably better that way OK. Any other questions? OK, hold on I need to I need to share the screen. No, not the screen. I need to share something. Oh, I need to upload the course. I need to upload the course. Right, I need to upload the course. Create course material. Lecture notes. Alright. Upload a file. See. How come I got two versions of signal and system? Let me check. Hold on a second. I've got. OK. All Hmm, how come? That's not quite right. Okay, I'll give you the first version. I'm not sure about the second versions. Okay. How come it takes forever? I don't know. Is it? Yes. Because many people use iPad for learning and I don't think that Docs in iPad works pretty well. Oh, I see. You want me to change it into PDF? Yes. Hold on. Let me save it into PDF. I got to print. Microsoft print to PDF. Okay. Hold on. Course classes. What's the name of the? One. So. Okay, hold on one second. Okay, you want a PDF? Let's choose a different one. Okay, ready. Publish. Save. Okay, here it is. Action notes. Okay. And what's next? I need to open. Okay. Okay. Now I need a system. Hold on one second. Okay. I think it's already uploaded so you can download them. Okay. And I need to change to my. iPad as well. Okay. I need to sync this. Okay. Sorry. Some. Somehow my. Thing doesn't come up. Okay, here it is. Okay, let me see. All right. I hope everybody have up download the lecture notes. Okay, we can continue. Okay. Is there any questions cannot download the website crutches? Oh, really? Me too. Oh. Oh, how come? Oh. My cost wheel crutches. Okay. Okay. I'll do that again. Hold on. Okay. How come it's. Yeah, this is the worst part of the my cost wheel is sometimes is it's not stable. Okay. Maybe it's too many pictures. It takes. It takes a while before it's is it. Maybe I should, I should divide them into. Okay. This one say election note is ready. Which and says. Try again. Okay, it should come down. Right. Okay. Okay. You should get it now right. Work now. Okay, it works. Okay, good. What shall I do? Okay, we'll change the screen. I'll share my screen on my iPad. Okay. Okay. Here. Okay. Good. Everyone can see what I'm sharing. Yes. Oh, no. I hope so. Okay. All right. Let's see. Okay. Fundamental of signal and systems. Okay. For this class. I suggest you have passed. I assume you have passed advanced mathematics last semester. Okay, to continue to continue with this class. Okay. Because this class is basically you need to solve differential equations, but I'm not going to include any details on that anymore. Okay, because I assume that you're going to learn it in advanced mathematics. Okay. So, but we're going to talk more than that. Okay, more than just differential equation. Differential equation is just a part of it. Okay, just a small part of it. Okay. Most of them we're going to turn about signals. Okay, and systems. Okay, the word system in this case, it may usually we can model it as differential equations. That's all. Okay, but we are more general meaning of systems. Okay, more general meaning of systems. I get what subset of it is differential equations. Okay, but we're going to learn a lot more than just differential equation of force. Okay, that's why we have another course called signal and systems. Okay, are you ready? We shall start. Okay. Today, we probably don't have the end of lecture quizzes just like it's unlike the probability and statistics you just had. Okay. Today, I'm going to give you pop quiz. Okay, during the lectures. Okay, so follow the lecture carefully. Okay, it costs to 4% towards your final exams, towards your grades. Okay. All right, let's start. Signals. Okay, what is a signal? Anybody? Can you give me an example of a signal? No class participation for that. No. What is a signal? What do you think about what do you think about a signal? Radar. Radar is a signal. Okay. Why is radar a signal? It gives a radio frequency. Frequency. How come how come we call it a signal? Is there any radar could be a signal if you try to get something out of it? Okay, according to this definition, you see the definition I'm telling you here. The signal supposed to be physical phenomenon that can convey information. Okay. The important thing is convey information. Okay. It got to give you some information. Okay, to be a signal. For example, some signal of hands gesture. Okay, hand gesture. For example, if I give you, okay, everybody look at the video I'm doing. Okay. You give you this signal. What does it mean if I wave my hand like this? Come here. Come here. Come here. Okay. Is that right? Yes. How about this one? I think maybe the same. It's the same. And how do you say go away? Brush your hands out. Is it out or in? Out. You see, it's different. It's different. But at least it can convey some information. It could mean come in or it could be go away. Is it go away like this and come in like this? Yeah, yes. Yeah, this is the difference between the cultures. Okay. Thai culture we use this one. We don't use this one to become in. But in the US, okay, if you come, this is come in. Okay. And this one go away. There is a difference. Okay. In the US, this one means go away. This one means comes in. Okay. But in Thailand, if you say come in this way, do you understand? Maybe. Maybe, yes. Maybe, but it's kind of rude, right? Yes. But if you come in this way, it's more polite. It depends on the culture. Okay. Anyway, but that's a signal. Hence gesture is a signal or traffic light. Traffic light, a signal, right? If you see the red light, what does it mean? To stop. You got to stop. Okay. If you see the green light, what does it mean? To go. You got to go. If you see the yellow light, what do you mean? What does it mean? To stop. Normally, it means prepare to stop, right? But mostly for most drivers, it means... Speed up. Sorry, to pass through it. Yeah. Yeah. You press the acceleration to speed up, to pass through it before the green, before the red light. Okay. Which is not so good. Okay. Well, actually usually it conveys some information. Okay. Honking the horn. What does it mean? Honking the horn. Yow. Honking the horn. What does it mean? Yow. To show a signal. To walk to one another. There is a danger ahead of them. Right. Okay. To honk the horn means you're in danger. Okay. You got to go away. Right? Be careful. Okay. Don't cross the road. Okay. If you want to let somebody cross the road, what do you do? If you're driving and somebody wants to cross the road and you want to let them cross the road, what would you do? You stop and wave your hand. What's your hand? Oh, really? Stop and wave your hand? Wave. Actually, this is the difference. Okay. In the U.S. If you honk your horn, okay. Actually means, okay. In the U.S., if you honk your horn, it means you're in danger. Okay. Please be careful. But if you want to let people cross the road in the U.S., we turn on the headlight. We flash the headlight. Okay. We flash the headlight. That means, okay. I'm going to let you cross the road. I'm going to stop. Okay. Be prepared to cross the road. Okay. But in Thailand, it's different. When it first came back to Thailand, it's like, when I want to cross the road and somebody flashed the headlight, and I thought it means they're going to let me cross the road. But actually, it means be careful. Don't cross the road. I'm going to go through. Did it happen to you? In Thailand, flashing the lights means you are trying to show your frustrations. Yeah. In Thailand, it's totally different meaning, right? If you flash the headlight, that means I'm frustrated. I don't let you go. You are being bad on the road. It's so totally different. But anyway, all of them are signals. Okay. It conveys some information, but it depends on the system is how you interpret the signal. Okay. So basically, this is what I say. Roughly, signals are physical phenomenon that convey information. Okay. And mathematically, a signal is often represented by a function of independent variables. Okay. In this case, I use variables with parenthesis s. That means it could be one variable or more than one variable. Okay. And mathematically, okay, for example, here, the first one. Let me show. Okay. This signal, okay. This is a signal and the independent variable is t. Okay. t is independent variables and x is called the dependent variable. Okay. x is the dependent variable. t is the independent variable. x of t is a signal. Okay. This is a signal called AM signal. Okay. Amplitude modulate the perimeter. And this is the AM signal. Have you ever heard of AM signal? AM channel. If you listen to radio in the past, there are two different kind of frequencies, the AM channels and the what? FM. FM. Okay. AM and FM channels. Okay. This one is AM. Okay. Amplitude modulated. Okay. You can see the amplitude changing. Okay. The amplitude changing. Big and small, big and small. Okay. This is another signal. Okay. Another signal called the low pass filter signal. Okay. The step response of the low pass filter. Okay. This is another signal. Okay. Here is the signal. Okay. Car bumper height. Okay. After car strike, a speed bump. When the car comes to a speed bump, okay, it will jump, right? Okay. It will come out like this. Okay. The height will go jumped down and then kind of stop. Okay. At the end. Okay. This is another signal. These are continuous signal. Okay. Continuous time signals. Okay. These are what? The light intensity from a Q switch laser. Okay. This is the FM signal. Right. Frequency shift. Okay. This is a frequency shift signal. Okay. You can see different frequency means different things. Okay. This probably means one. This one means zero. One zero zero one, for example. Okay. This is a frequency shift signal. Okay. Okay. It could be one one like this. Okay. So it shifted. High frequency is a one low frequency is a zero and so on. Okay. And this one is the band, or base band binary bit. Okay. This one could be what? Zero one. Okay. If it's negative is a one zero and this is a one zero and one one and so on. Okay. It depends. Okay. How you regulate these signals. Okay. But all of them are signals. It conveys some information. Okay. It conveys some information. What they tell us about, you know, like this one tells us the height. Right. This one tells us the height of the speed bump. I mean, the window car hit a speed speed bump ago up and down, up and down. Okay. And then slow down like this. Okay. And this one tells us the digital signal. These two last two tell us digital signal zero and one and so on. Okay. So that's the signal. Okay. And desirable signal is called noise. Okay. For this class. Okay. Usually these are desired. Usually this class is about noise is I'm sorry. I mean, what I'm trying to say is usually the the signal like this. Okay. These are called deterministic signal. Okay. Is signal that you can describe mathematically. Okay. Is this describe you can describe them mathematically. Okay. But the noise signal is the one that is random. Okay. This noise signal is random. Okay. It's not deterministic. It's random. Okay. Is this a random signal because you cannot predict what's the sit the noise signals look like. Okay. The noise is the one that's usually disturb the deterministic signal that we want to determine. Okay. And when you got a deterministic signal and then you got noise. Okay. To disturb that. Okay. Which is undesirable. Of course. Okay. If you have noise, you got to learn what probability. Okay. Probability and statistic which is you you just had. Okay. That property and statistics is the is the course that's talk about randomness. Okay. And it involves noise. Okay. So that's the state. Okay. But for this class, we are not going to learn the noise. Okay. We concentrate on deterministic one. Okay. Not not the PDF. Okay. Not the noise. Okay. If you want to learn about the noisy noisy signals. Okay. We learn another course. Okay. So we are going to learn what we call random signal and systems. Okay. Which involves this whatever we learn this class plus the property and statistics in the previous class. Okay. Combine the two. You got a new class called random signal and systems. Okay. But for this class, we just determine it is deterministic signal and systems. Okay. Number four. Okay. A system. What is a system? We got a signal. A signal is something that convey information. Right. What is a system? Okay. According to this definition, it says is the processing of signal. Okay. Or manipulation on signals for a certain purpose. Okay. So basically we have this one. This is called a system. We usually draw it as a block diagram. Okay. And the input is called the input signal. The input signal is sometimes called excitation. Okay. Is to excite the system. Okay. That means you feed in some signal and the system will manipulate it somehow. Okay. Process it somehow. Okay. For a certain purpose. Okay. For a certain purpose. That means it could be for interpretation for compression for. What? Transmission for utilization of some information of such information. Remember signal carry information. Right. And system. Manipulate it. Extract the information out of the signal. You know what I'm saying? Okay. System is a way to extract or process the signal until you get the such information. Okay. The output of the system is called a response. Okay. The output signal is usually called a response to the system. Okay. So remember the main concepts here. Okay. For example. Okay. To interpret waving a hand. If I wave a hand, I give you a signal. What do you do? What is the system? What is a system? The system is you. Your brain. Your brain. Right. Exactly. When you wave a hand, I give you a signal. Right. Or I talk to you. Right. Your brain is processing the signal and you interpret it as okay. Bye bye. Right. Or the late light comes up. Right. That's the signal. And what you do? What's your response? You stop the car. That's the response. What's the system? System is also your brain. Also your brain. Okay. The system could be so complicated. Right. It involves your brain, your reaction to your legs. Right. To your reaction to the what? To the to the to hit the brain. Right. However, if the automatic car, if it's an automatic car, right, like Tesla is having, right. They have AI to drive the car. Right. In that case, you've got to decide the whole system to do that. Right. You've got to capture the what? The whole system could be so complicated. Right. You see the late the red light. Okay. And then it's feed to some complicated process. Okay. Complicated process. Okay. Like this. Okay. And at the end, the car stops. Okay. Stop the car. The whole thing could be the whole systems. Okay. Could involves a lot of things. Right. Could involves what? And each one, each one of them will be the subsystems. Right. Subsystem could be, you know, image processing process the image of the red light and then could be what mechanical processing. Okay. Somehow. Push the break and so on. Okay. You could think of it the system as a whole block diagrams. Okay. Within the block diagrams. Oh, Pete says I need to add someone to the team. Okay, hold on. Okay. Did I? Okay. Pan the week. Right. Okay. I have added you to the team. Okay. Oh, where are we? Okay. Same here. Okay. Car honking may imply be careful and it's dangerous. Okay. The interpretation of car honking is the system. Okay. And the output is to be careful. Right. And you do something to respond to that. Okay. That will be the output of the systems. Okay. So you remember this one, this, this, this diagram is very important. Okay. That's called signal and system. Okay. So the systems are the input and the output of the systems. Okay. And the system is the thing that we decide. Okay. For real applications. Okay. All right. For example, okay. When a person speak to you, your brain, okay, as a system, process is that the voice, which is a signal into the meaningful words and sentences. Okay. That's called the systems, the signal and systems. Or this one, communication system. Okay. A communication system composed of information signal. Okay. A signal contains some information. Okay. And it could go through some transmitters. Okay. For example, right now. Okay. I'm talking here. Okay. My voice go into the microphone. Right. The microphone goes through what transmit. Right. And of course, there are some background noise. Okay. Can be added. Okay. And then it goes to the channel. The channel in this case is the way that it goes from my computer. Right. The signal. My voice change into electronic signals. Right. Into my computer. My computer's transmit the signal. Computer signals. Right. Transmit the zero and one bits. Okay. Through the network channel. This one means through the network. Right. Through the network to your home. Okay. To your home. And at your home. What do you do? What's the signal going? It goes through the receiver. Right. At your computer. And it changed my the electronics signals there. Okay. Back into the voice. Right. Back into the my voices. Okay. Which may contain noises. Okay. Because in each time you got the system. Usually there's some noise added to it. Okay. And it go to your side. Your side will listen. You hear my voice. Okay. And it got to go through. Even though it's one is noisy. Right. It got to go to some noise cancellation. Right. In your computer. And so on. Okay. And that will be another systems. Okay. Before you can hear it clearly. Okay. And some of those. Okay. So basically we can think of a system is a block diagram. Okay. Within the system is depends on how you decide. Okay. How you model them. Okay. So mathematically. So mathematically a system is modeled. Okay. By a differential equations. Okay. For example here this is a mod. This is a system. Okay. We can describe a system by a mathematical model. Okay. For example this is a system. Okay. Model by this equation. Okay. What is this? This is a question. What are we measuring? Here. The volume. Right. The volume of the inflow. Okay. This is the volume. Right. This is the height. Water level. Actually. This is the water level. Okay. So in this case the output is ht. See. H1t is the output signal. Okay. Ht is the output signal. Input signal. What's the input signal? Input signal. In this case there are. There is. Well in this equation there is only one of them. Right. Which is f1. Okay. How much. How much the water or the liquid. Right. Is flowing in. Okay. How much the liquid is flowing in. This is the input. F1 is the input. Okay. And it goes through some mathematical modeling. Okay. To get the output signal. Okay. How do we get these mathematical models? Well. Like in advanced mathematics I used to tell you it came from physical mis-phenomenon. You got to understand the physical of it. Okay. And you form the differential equations. Okay. This is the differential equation you are solving. Okay. And that's how you get the output with different input. Okay. Input here. This is f1t. Okay. With different inputs you got different outputs according to this differential equations. You get that. Okay. So this is the whole class that we can be learning. Is that seems a lot of fun to you. Hopefully. Okay. And in this case I added the word difference equation. Okay. Here we got differential equations for continuous signals. Continuous time signal. Okay. Continuous time signal. And difference equation for discrete time signal. Okay. For discrete time signals. Okay. We are going to part here. Actually we are going to learn for this class we are going to learn. We are going to learn two parts. Okay. Continuous time signal. And systems. And continuous time systems. Okay. And then we are going to learn discrete time signal. Okay. And discrete time systems. Okay. Of course continuous time signal is what differential equation is described by differential equations. Okay. But discrete time signal is described by difference equations. Okay. Difference equation. Which is slightly different from the differential equations. Okay. For the differential equation I already assume you have passed advanced mathematics. Okay. So I am just going to touch on it but not go into details on it. Okay. For the difference equation it is going to be quite similar. But of course it is new to you. Okay. We are going to learn more on this one. Okay. Learn more on this one. Okay. It is quite similar to the differential equations. But this class is not just on this. Okay. Actually the whole thing here. Okay. Which we are going to learn in the second half on to solve differential equations and difference equation. And not the way. Okay. Instead of the mathematics we learn in advanced mathematics. Okay. We are going to learn to solve it in frequency domain. In frequency domain. Okay. This is new for this class. Okay. For this class we learn in frequency domain. Okay. For advanced mathematics we learn it in time domain. Okay. We solve it in time domain. Okay. But for this class we concentrate on solving it in frequency domain. Okay. This is probably new to you. Okay. This is the second system. Okay. This is discrete time system. Okay. This is a discrete time system. Okay. It is a system similar to the differential equation except this is a difference. Okay. This is like this. What? Yn goes to the D here and it becomes Yn minus 1. Okay. Yn minus 1 go to the D here. It becomes Yn minus 2. Okay. It is shifted delay. Okay. These D stands for delay. Okay. Unit delay. Okay. It is called unit delay. Okay. It is delay by 1. Okay. And then this add up to and we got these equations. Okay. So we got X1. Right. This one you are going to get Yn. Okay. Let me. Raise it a little. Okay. This one you can see it is equal to what? This Yn. Right. It is equal to plus. Right. So it is equal to Xn plus. This one we got Yn times B. Right. So there is a negative sign here. Right. So it is negative minus. Okay. What is in here? Okay. Here this is C. Right. This is a plus. What is the plus between? It is between B, this line, which is B times Yn minus 1. And then this is a plus. This is a plus. So it is plus C times Yn minus 2. So it is equal to Xn plus B, Yn minus 1 plus here. Okay. The parenthesis. C, Yn minus 2. Okay. And that's how we get this system. So if you move, oh, there's an a here. Okay. This is the output and multiply with the a. Right. So the whole thing. Is that right? Yeah. There's an a here. So we got Y a times Yn. Okay. And then we move these two terms to the left hand side and how you this is how we get the answer. Okay. This is how we get the answer. So we got a Yn plus B, Yn minus 1 plus C, Yn minus 2 equal to Xn. Okay. This is called the difference equation. Difference equations. Okay. This is called the difference equation. Okay. The one previously, this is one differential equation. Why is it called differential equations? Because it involved the derivative of H1. Okay. This is H1 and this is the derivative of S1. So this one is called the differential equations. Okay. And that's the continuous time. Right. T is continuous and N is discrete. Okay. All right. This is basically what we're going to learn today for this class. Okay. Wow. Okay. Let's continue a little bit more. I guess. I guess. Maybe. Where is the course service? Oh, actually, according to this, toward the course service, we finished this mathematical modeling. Okay. How about I take the class participants. Okay. And see. Let's see. Shall I read? Yes. Yes. So that's the Yn minus 1 and N minus 2. Where did that come from? Or is that just what's given to us? The delay. Right. It goes to the delay. The unit delay. Okay. Yn minus 1 is the delay of Yn. Okay. Yn minus 2 is the delay of Yn minus 1. Unit delay of Yn minus 1. Okay. All right. How about I use instant queue. Okay. Let me share the screen. Okay. There's no NL class quizzes, but I'm going to give you the instant queue. So everybody goes on. Go to the what? Instant queue in my course view. Okay. Okay. And answer the questions. Okay. What should be the questions? Okay. What was the question? How about this? Oh, this is on a fly. Okay. So give me some time to think. Okay. What should be the first question? Okay. Which of the following is a signal? Okay. By definition of our class. Okay. This is a signal. Okay. Which of the following is a signal? For example, what's that? Robots. Okay. Red light. Maybe. Okay. What could be a signal? What's the signal? Your car when. Being. Red light. How about that? And what's the choice? Number three. How about this? Red light. Traffic light. Traffic light. Okay. What else could be as. Okay. Break. Okay. Give me an answer. Okay. On and out. Which of the following is a signal? Okay. I. you you can you find the instant queue on my course view now? I found it. Okay, good. Okay, 75 people. Okay, two more people. And then I'll take off. Okay, take it off air and see the responses. Wow, how come traffic light and red light, how come it's the same? How come traffic lights giving you signals that not the red light? Why? What's why why why most people I thought maybe my question is not so clear. So traffic light is more of a signal source, right? What's that? I'm sorry. Traffic light is more of a signal source, right? Oh, red light, traffic light is a signal source. I think I think somebody think that not somebody a lot of people think that traffic light and red light are the same thing, I guess. Yeah, I see. I see. Maybe I should say traffic light flashing. How about that? I thought the grants are supposed to be red light because red light give you a signal with information. Traffic light is just I thought of it as just a poll with you know, it's not giving you signal yet, it's just a source of signal. Yeah, precisely. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Okay, I think the correct answer should be traffic light. And I'm sorry, I meant the correct answer should be red light. I'm sorry to interrupting you but like in well I do answer red red light but like according to what friends say in the in the north it says like example of signals are traffic light. So I think it's like both of the choices are the scores because like the north you you read the north right but from my explanation I think it's pretty curious isn't it? Where's my note? Okay, maybe your explanation is that it's just a light bulb. I see signals are hand gestures, traffic lights right. In the north it's a traffic light but it should be red light flashing right is it? But from what I try to explain to you red light is giving you information. Traffic lights in general, I mean in this case I meant you know like the poll right that give you is haven't give you any of the right yet but in in my lecture note I say traffic lights with an S but this one traffic traffic light with no S does it mean anything? Traffic light with an S that means it could give you red or green or blue. I have red not green or blue. Red or yellow or green right but traffic light just one traffic light with no light I think is well anyway okay but from my interpretation maybe I got to reface yeah sometimes there is a not clear cut right but I got to be careful with this okay but just remember signal got to be something that convey information that's the most important one okay okay next okay what's the second questions how about the second questions how about the systems okay okay what should be the second questions uh how about the what what could be the second questions could should should be something about system what's the questions about system which of the following is systems okay okay a machine okay what else is a machine a system uh what could be a system maybe you can give us scenarios and let us identify which part of your scenario is the system oh I see okay yeah that could be a good idea that could be a good question okay give us a scenario and says what's the what's the system right okay okay which of the sorry is correct okay flashing of the following is act system okay okay your reaction to hit the break your car it stopped and what is stop your car is that true enough okay it's not so clear anyway okay go ahead and answer that okay oh how come there are 80 people now yeah this is an owl an owl is teaching okay look at an owl okay 20 more people hit hurry up okay hurry up although you okay 79 people come on one last person are you there if not I'm gonna take it off air now we're running out of time okay that's it I won't wait okay let's see alright interpretation that you need to stop your car would be a system okay remember system is the manipulation of signal okay you get the signal and your brain interpret okay the reaction to hit the break would be the outcome okay would be the outcome right the car is stopped would be the outcome after hitting the break okay and actually reaction to hit the break after the break right when hit the break the system would be what the engine the car engine go through some system and then the car is stopped that's another system right okay I guess that's it for today okay you understand everything right I hope so okay and we'll continue with this on Friday and hopefully I'll make up the quiz at the end of the lectures okay at this point you have any other questions so anybody else okay if you shall leave okay thank you very much for paying attention to this class okay
